# Homework 4: The Interactive TODO List
---

### **Short Description**

This is a simple web-based TODO list that is able to add new tasks, delete tasks, and edit existing tasks and save the changes. The application will give user feedback if the user tries to add invalid tasks. It is built using JavaScript and Bootstrap classes. It does not include any custom CSSâ€”all styling and layout are handled using Bootstrap utility classes directly in the JavaScript and HTML.

Key Features:

DOM Manipulation: All elements are created and managed using native DOM methods like document.createElement() and appendChild().

Bootstrap Styling: Buttons, spacing, alignment, and layout are styled using Bootstrap classes such as:

btn, btn-sm, btn-outline-primary, btn-outline-danger

d-flex, align-items-center, mb-2, ms-2, me-1, etc.

There is no custom CSS file involved.
